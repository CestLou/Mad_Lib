   <h2> Mad Libs </h2>
   <h1> The labyrinth </h1>
   <p> Once upon a time, there was a little boy by the name of __[name]__ who was the adventurous of them all. One day he took a trip to the __[adjective]__[noun]__ and all the sudden a man pops out of no where and yells __[exclamation ex Boo]__! The boy was so __[adjective]__ he passed out. It turns out the man who made the boy pass out was __[noun]/[name]__. Once the boy awoken he looks around and yells “Hello, where am I!" It turns out the boy was in a huge labyrinth, where it was almost __[adjective]__ to get out. Here the boy finds two signs, the left one said “To the __[noun]__” and the right one said “To the __[noun]__.” So the boy decided to go to the left. Though do to his __[adjective]__ decision at the end of that path he finds thousands of __[plural noun]__. So the boy runs back and goes down the right path, while calling for help. Along the right path he finds a/an __[object]__ which allows him to burst through the wall. The boy __[adverb]__ goes though the hole he made and finds a __[adjective]__ stair case leading down into the underground where the devil lives. As he travels down the stairs he’s see the man who put him here, but all the sudden two __[adjective]__ angles swoop him up and take him to the big man up stairs where the boy is saved and he lives __[adverb]__ ever after. One may say the boys adventurous aspect made him the __[noun -ist]__ of them all. </p>
